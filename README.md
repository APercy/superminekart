Racing
=======

This is a very strange modpack. This mod started as an idea after I watched a replay of a 1991 Formula 1 race, where it showed Ayrton Senna's first victory in a race at Brazil, his country (and mine too). As it would be too ambitious to adapt the minetest for F1, I decided to do something fun, a kart race. Without so much commitment to real life, but with some interesting things, like your car getting faster as it consumes fuel and some that can be noticed while playing.

So, this strange modpack is dedicated to Ayrton Senna

FAQ

1. I would like to try it but I was confused by the documentation on how to use the checkpoints: Ok, my English is terrible, but I prepared a mini map with a circuit already set up so that you can explore the operation and even host a game. Unzip the karttest.zip file in the worlds folder of your minetest. But before running this map, make sure you have the following mods installed: basic_machines, basic_materials, moreblocks, racing, worldedit

2. I need feedback, so, this section will increase
